# Research Paper Implementations

Welcome to the repository of implementations for various influential research papers in the field of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Each implementation is designed to be as close to the original paper as possible while being easy to understand and modify.

## Setup

To set up the repository, please follow the instructions below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henilp105/Research-paper-implementations.git
cd Research-paper-implementations
```

## Usage

Each paper's implementation is contained within its own directory. To run an implementation, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory. 

Example:
```bash
cd 'Attention is all you need'
python main.py
```
