handle them id double their tax and command them to supply 10000 men to the royal army um whats the line a royal army why should every lord command his own men it primitive no better than the hill tribe we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldier instead of a mob of peasant whove never held pike in their life and if the northerner rebel id crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm a warden of the north uncle kevan maybe the king shit and the hand wipe and these 10000 northern troop would they fight for you or their lord for me im their king mmhm but youve just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brother im not asking the north cannot be held not by an outsider it too big and too wild and when the winter

weve provided you with some good story to tell when youre back in king landing it something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothel all too well i still carry a token of his esteem half the boy youve seen training will die north of the wall might be a wildlings axe that get them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump

father voice come out is my father wrong let say viserys targaryen land with 40000 dothraki screamer at his back we hole up in our castle a wise move only a fool would meet the dothraki in an open field they leave u in our castle they go from town to town looting and burning killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crop and livestock enslaving all our woman and child how long do the people of the seven kingdom stand behind their absentee king their cowardly king hiding behind high wall when do the people decide that viserys targaryen is the rightful monarch after all we still outnumber them which is the bigger number five or one five five one one army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose our purpose died with the mad king now weve got a many army a there are men with gold in their purse and everybody want something different your father want to own the world ned stark want to run away and bury his head in the snow what do you want we

fucked one girl from each of the seven kingdom and the riverlands we used to call it making the eight those were some lucky girl you ever make the eight barristan i dont believe so your grace those were the day which day exactly the one where half of westeros fought the other half and million died or before that when the mad king slaughtered woman and baby i cant rule the kingdom if the starks and the lannisters because the voice in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragon burned whole city to the ground easy boy you might be my brother but youre speaking to the king i suppose it wa all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight more wine your grace they burned most everything in the riverlands our field our granary are at each others throat so enough our home they took our woman then they took em again when they wa done they butchered them a if they wa animal they covered our

glorified bodyguard for two king one a madman the other a drunk the future of our family will be determined in these next few month we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand year or we could collapse into nothing a the targaryens did i need you to become the man you were always meant to be not next year not tomorrow now youre in pain lannisters ive had worse my lady perhaps it time to go home the south doesnt seem to agree with you i know the truth jon arryn died for do you lord stark is that why you called me here to pose me riddle ha he done this before jaime would have killed him my brother is worth a thousand of your friend your brother or your lover dont act like fool the targaryens wed brother and sister for 300 year to keep bloodline pure jaime and i are more than brother and sister we shared a womb we came into this world together we belong together my son saw you with him do you love your child with all my heart no more than i love mine and theyre all jaimes thank the god in the rare event that robert leaf his whore for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed are you going to say something clever i finish him off in other way in the morning he doesnt remember youve always hated him hated him i worshipped him every girl in the seven kingdom dreamed of him but he wa mine by oath and when i finally saw him on our wedding day in the sept of baelor lean and fierce and blackbearded it wa the happiest moment of my life that night he crawled on top of me stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do and whispered in my ear lyanna i just i always wanted to be a ranger i always wanted to be a wizard what no im serious so youll stay and say your word with me lord stark a moment alone if you will he named you protector of the realm he did she wont care give me an hour and i can put a hundred sword at your command and what should i do with a hundred sword strike tonight while the castle sleep we must get joffrey away from his mother and into our custody protector of the realm or no he who hold the king hold the kingdom every moment you delay give cersei another moment to prepare by the time robert dy it will be too late for the both of u what about stannis saving the seven kingdom from cersei and delivering them to stannis you have odd notion about protecting the realm stannis is your older brother this isnt about the bloody line of succession that didnt matter when you rebelled against the mad king it shouldnt matter now whats best for the kingdom whats best for the people we rule we all know what stannis is he inspires no love or loyalty he not a king i am stannis is a commander he led men into war twice he destroyed the greyjoy fleet yes he a good soldier everyone know that so wa robert tell me something do you still believe good soldier make good king i will not dishonour robert last hour by shedding blood in his hall and dragging frightened child from their bed you will sail to dragonstone tonight you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon not his steward not his captain of the guard and not his wife only stannis himself yes my lord now leave u my lord protector the king ha no trueborn son joffrey and tommen are jaime lannisters bastard so when the king dy the throne pass to his brother lord stannis so it would seem unless there is no unless he is the rightful heir nothing can change that and he cannot take the throne without your help you would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure joffrey succeeds do you have a shred of honour you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm all of the power is yours you need only reach out and take it make peace with the lannisters release the imp wed your daughter to joffrey weve plenty of time to get rid of stannis and if joffrey seems likely to cause problem when he come into his throne we simply reveal his little secret and seat lord renly there instead we youll need someone to share these burden i assure you my price would be modest what you suggest is treason only if we lose make peace with the lannisters you say with the people who tried to murder my boy we only make peace with our enemy my lord thats why it called making peace no i wont do it so it will be stannis and war there is no other choice he is the heir so why did you call me here not for my wisdom clearly you promised catelyn you would help me the queen ha a dozen knight and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard i need the gold cloak the city watch is 2000 strong and sworn to defend the king peace look at you you know what you want me to do you know it ha to be done but it not honourable so the word stick in your throat when the queen proclaims one king and the hand proclaims another whose peace do the gold cloak protect who do they follow the man who pay them hear my word and bear witness to my vow night gather and now my watch begin it shall not end until my death i shall take no wife hold no land father no child i shall wear no crown and win no glory i shall live and die at my post i am the sword in the darkness i am the watcher on the wall i am the shield that guard the realm of men i pledge my life and honour to the night watch for this night and all the night to come you knelt a boy rise now a men of the night watch well done well done whats he got there to me ghost bring it here god be good what will they do to him when the khalasar ride hell be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horse for a long a he can and when he fall i saw a man last nine mile once king robert still want me dead this poisoner wa the first he wont be the last i thought hed leave me alone now that my brother is gone he will never leave you alone if you ride to darkest asshai his assassin will follow you if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isle his spy would tell him he will never abandon the hunt youre a targaryen the last targaryen your son will have targaryen blood with 40000 rider behind him he will not have my son he will not have you either khaleesi moon of my life are you hurt jorah the andal i heard what you did choose any horse you wish it is yours i make this gift to you and to my son the stallion who will mount the world i will also pledge a gift i will give him the iron chair that his mother father sat upon i will give him seven kingdom i drogo will do this i will take my khalasar west to where the world end and ride wooden horse across the black salt water a no khal ha done before i will kill the men in iron suit and tear down their stone house i will rape their woman take their child a slave and bring their broken god back to vaes dothrak this i vow i drogo son of bharbo i swear before the mother of mountain a the star look down in witness a the star look down in witness lord stark stop no all right it all right let him through lord stark king joffrey and the queen regent request your presence in the throne

would do whatever wa right no matter what then lord stark is one man in 10000 most of u are not so strong what is honour compared to a woman love and what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arm or a brother smile what do you want tell me sam told you were all human oh we all do our duty when there no cost to it honour come easy then yet sooner or later in every man life there come a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose and this is my day no riddle no story tell me what do you want is that what youre saying oh it hurt boy oh yes i know you do not know no one know i

unaccustomed to wine i forgot how afraid i wa around girl how i wa always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother you grew up with actor i forgot about everything but tysha and somehow i found myself in her bed for three chicken i should hope so it didnt last long i didnt know what the hell i wa doing but she wa good to me she kissed me afterwards and sang me a song and by morning i wa deep enough in love to ask for her hand a few lie a few gold coin one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife you learned their craft and

because you are going to the deepest of the seven hell if the god are just what god are those the tree your husband prayed to where were the tree when his head wa getting chopped off if your god are

stark boy appears to be le green than wed hoped ive heard his wolf killed a dozen men and a many horse but rhaegar targaryen kidnapped her is it true about stannis and renly both baratheon brother have taken up against u jaime captured his army scattered it a catastrophe perhaps we should sue for peace there your peace joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove ned starks head youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing robb stark to the table now he winning robert started a war to win her back in case you hadnt noticed im told we still have his sister the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime no truce we cant afford to look weak we should march on them at once first we must return to casterly rock to raise they have my son get out all of you not you you were right about eddard stark if he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun which would have given u more time to deal with robert brother but now he killed rhaegar but she died anyway madness madness and stupidity i always thought you were a stunted fool perhaps i wa wrong half wrong im new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three army it appears we cant stay here no one will stay here ser gregor will head out with 500 rider and set the riverland on fire from god eye to the red fork the rest of u will regroup at harrenhal thats where i saw father and you will go to king landing and do what rule you will serve a hand of the king in my stead you will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if need be and if you
